    "The diceEM framework can be applied to a real bioinformatics problem: \n",
    "inferring the sequences recognized by a transcription factor (TF).\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as in the diceEM, we'll start our work on this problem by first generating\n",
    "samples of the data we hope to infer parameters from later. This will generate\n",
    "examples to work with and help you understand how to frame the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a slight variation on the bag-of-dice problem. In this version, the\n",
    "bag contains two types dice collections. Each collection contains dice whose \n",
    "faces represent DNA bases and indicates the order\n",
    "in which the dice are to be rolled. Each die may have different face\n",
    "probabilities. After a collection is drawn at random from the bag, the dice\n",
    "are rolled in the indicated order, the collection is returned to the bag, and\n",
    "then the next collection is drawn. One type of collection is known as the motif\n",
    "model and the other as the background model. The motif model represents the types\n",
    "of sequences that are bound by the transcription factor, while the background\n",
    "model represents all sequences in a genome. In the background model there is\n",
    "just one die that is rolled the designated number of times to produce a\n",
    "sequence of the required length.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using numbers to represent bases for convenience in this lab, with the\n",
    "following mapping:\n",
    "\n",
    "```raw\n",
    "A <-> 0\n",
    "C <-> 1\n",
    "G <-> 2\n",
    "T <-> 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected output of your sampling function will be numbers in the range of 0\n",
    "to 3.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, You will write a function called site_sample that takes\n",
    "3 arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `sequence_model` = This is an object that stores the parameters of\n",
    "our  binding site probability model.\n",
    "- `num_draws` = the number of times to draw a sequence from the bag\n",
    "- `seed` = a random seed that makes the randomness reproducible \n",
    "\n",
    "## SequenceModel\n",
    "\n",
    "The SequenceModel object is similar to the BagOfDice in that it stores the\n",
    "parameters that describe the probability of observing a given sequence vs\n",
    "a sequence drawn from the background. The SequenceModel object has the\n",
    "following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `site_prior` = the probability of drawing a sequence from the bag that is bound\n",
    "  by the transcription factor. This is a number between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `background_base_probs` = a list of 4 numbers that sum to 1, representing the\n",
    "  probability of seeing each base in a sequence drawn from the background model.\n",
    "  We will assume that non-bound sites are essentially drawn at random\n",
    "  from a distribution one-by-one, so the chances of seeing an 'A' are the same,\n",
    "  regardless of the position in the sequence. One possible background_base_probs input\n",
    "  would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    background_base_probs = [.2, .2, .3, .3]\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  which would indicate that non-bound sequences are roughly 20% A's, 20% C's,\n",
    "  30% G's, and 30% T's.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `site_base_probs` = a list of lists, with each sublist containing 4 numbers\n",
    "  that sum to 1, representing the probability of seeing each base at a given\n",
    "  position in a sequence drawn from the foreground. This allows you to specify\n",
    "  position-dependent base frequencies. One  possible site_base_probs would\n",
    "  look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",

    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  This would specify a site that is 5 bases wide, with fair chances of seeing\n",
    "  either a C or G in the first two positions,  very high chances of seeing an A in\n",
    "  each of the next two positions, and Cs and Ts favored over As and G's in the\n",
    "  last position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Constructing a SequenceModel object would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> site_prior = 0.2\n",
    ">>> sm = SequenceModel(site_prior,\n",
